      <h3 class="blogh3">National Savings Certificate (NSC): A Safe Way to Grow Your Savings</h3>
      <p>If you’re looking for a low-risk, tax-saving investment that guarantees steady returns, the National Savings Certificate (NSC) is a solid choice. Backed by the Government of India, NSC is designed for conservative savers who want to grow their money safely.</p>
       
      <h3 class="blogh3">What is NSC? </h3>
      <p>The National Savings Certificate is a fixed-income investment scheme offered by the post office. It is primarily meant for small to mid-level investors looking for guaranteed returns over 5 years, along with tax benefits.</p>
      <h3 class="blogh3">Key Features of NSC: </h3>
      <p><b>Interest Rate (Currently 7.7%) :</b> The interest rate is fixed by the government and remains the same throughout the 5-year tenure. As of now, it is 7.7% compounded annually.</p>
      <p><b>Investment Limit:</b> Minimum investment is ₹1,000. There’s no maximum limit, but only up to ₹1.5 lakh per year qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.</p>
      <p><b>Tenure:</b> Fixed for 5 years. Funds can only be withdrawn after maturity, except in special cases like the holder’s death.</p>
      <p><b>Compounded Annually:</b> The interest is compounded annually but paid out only at the end of 5 years along with the principal.</p>
      <p><b>Tax Benefits :</b> Investment qualifies for deduction under Section 80C. However, interest earned is taxable as per your income slab.</p>

    </div>
     
     
      <h3 class="blogh3">Is It Safe? </h3>
      <p>Yes. NSC is fully backed by the central government, which means your money is secure. It’s not linked to the market, so your returns won’t fluctuate.</p>
       
      <h3 class="blogh3">Why Choose NSC?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Assured Growth of Savings Over 5 Years
          NSC offers a fixed interest rate for a full 5-year term, helping your money grow steadily. It’s ideal for short to medium-term goals, as the return is guaranteed and unaffected by market ups and downs.</li>
        <li>Tax Savings Up to ₹1.5 Lakh Under Section 80C
          You can claim a tax deduction of up to ₹1.5 lakh on your NSC investment under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. This not only helps you save money on taxes but also makes NSC an efficient savings tool.</li>
        <li>No Risk From Market Fluctuations
          Unlike shares or mutual funds, NSC returns are not linked to the stock market. Your capital and interest are safe, which is great for conservative investors looking for secure returns.</li>
