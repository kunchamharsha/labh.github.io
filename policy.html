    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Labh</strong> is an advanced financial research and wealth solutions platform built
      for the modern Indian investor. We combine deep quantitative research,
      rigorous fundamental analysis, and technology-driven execution to help
      investors make smarter, more disciplined investment decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Founded by professionals with experience across finance, engineering, and
      large-scale technology platforms, Labh was created to bridge a critical gap
      in the Indian investment ecosystem —
      <strong>institution-grade research made accessible to retail investors</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our team includes PhD mathematicians, CFA Level 3 professionals, qualified
      accountants, and experienced engineers, working together to design robust
      portfolio strategies focused on long-term wealth creation and effective
      risk management.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      At Labh, we specialize in curated investment baskets designed using a
      structured, data-backed approach:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Stock Baskets</strong> – Research-driven equity portfolios built
        using quantitative models, fundamental screening, and disciplined risk
        controls.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mutual Fund Baskets</strong> – Professionally constructed mutual
        fund portfolios optimized for asset allocation, diversification, and
        long-term consistency.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Each basket is continuously monitored and refined using advanced analytics,
      market data, and systematic portfolio management frameworks.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      We believe successful investing is not about short-term predictions or
      market noise, but about building a repeatable and disciplined process.
      Our core principles include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Process over emotions</li>
      <li>Risk management over return chasing</li>
      <li>Consistency over speculation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Our research frameworks emphasize downside protection, diversification,
      and probabilistic thinking — principles commonly used by institutional
      investors but rarely available to retail participants.
    </p>

    <h2>Built for Scale, Trust, and Transparency</h2>
    <p>
      Labh is built on a robust technology stack designed to deliver a seamless,
      reliable, and scalable experience. We operate with a strong focus on
      regulatory compliance, transparency, and investor education, ensuring
      users always understand the rationale, risks, and objectives behind every
      strategy.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      To empower Indian investors with research-first, unbiased, and
      data-driven investment solutions that stand the test of time.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      To become India’s most trusted platform for systematic, research-backed
      wealth creation.
